This is the source code for HomeCord's website.

## What is HomeCord?
HomeCord would have been a new twist on the classic Discord Server Listing websites - where instead of just trying to advertise Discord Communities, HomeCord would instead showcase a Community's activity (all configurable) on the Community's page on HomeCord's website.

This showcased activity would have included the following in the first version:
- Upcoming Scheduled Events
- Announcements made in the Discord Server
- Active public Threads & Forum Posts in the Discord Server
- Noteworthy recent messages sent in the Server (while respecting message author privacy by default)

With plans post-initial launch to also showcase the following:
- The Server's Shop tiers and/or products (if enabled via Discord's Server Monetization feature)
- Currently active Stage Channels & their topic
- A preview of the Server's Rules (if set via Discord's Rule Screening feature)
- ...and more

## Why was HomeCord made?
This version of HomeCord was originally made as part of Discord's Developer Buildathon (hosted in their [Discord Developers Server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers)).

While a strong attempt was made to finish a prototype version of HomeCord in time for submission in that Buildathon, the sole developer of this project simply ran out of steam (due to Christmas 2025 & New Years 2026 holiday) and hit a major roadblock with CSS/TailwindCSS both slowing development on this project.

As a result, this project will not be able to be submitted to the Buildathon in time. :(

## Will HomeCord continue to be made after the Buildathon?
After January 9th 2026 (the final submission date for the Buildathon), the sole developer of this project will be taking a short break from it, to not be burnt out.


<!--You can find the live site at [homecord.github.io](https://homecord.github.io) once this Buildathon project has reached stability needed to be published.-->
